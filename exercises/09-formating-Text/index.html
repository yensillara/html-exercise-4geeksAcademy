		<h1>This will be your heading</h1>
		<p>Then, your start talking about some interesting stuff that nobody wants to read</p>
		<p>Then you can quote someone to add credibility:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>A quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble of thinking for oneself, always a laborious business</p>
			<p>- A.A. Milne, If I May</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Finally you can have some bullet to summarize everithing, after all, new generations have things in common:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't like to read long text</li>
			<li>Have the spawn of attention of a bird</li>
			<li>Skip long paragrahs straight to the bullet points</li>
		</ul>
